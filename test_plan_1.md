## Test Plan 1: Checkout Step One Error Validation

### 1. Test Plan Overview
**Test Plan Name:** Checkout Step One Error Validation Test Plan

### 2. Introduction
This test plan defines the strategy and approach for testing the error validation functionality on the checkout step one page of the SauceDemo e-commerce application. The primary focus is to ensure that users cannot proceed to the checkout overview page when mandatory fields are missing.

### 3. Test Objectives
- Verify that all mandatory fields are properly validated during the checkout process
- Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed when required fields are empty
- Validate that users cannot proceed to the next step without completing all mandatory information
- Confirm that the checkout form validation works consistently across all required field combinations

### 4. Scope of Testing

#### 4.1 In Scope
- Checkout step one page form validation
- Error message display and content
- Mandatory field validation (First Name, Last Name, Zip/Postal Code)
- Form submission behavior with missing data
- User workflow interruption when validation fails
- All possible combinations of filled/unfilled mandatory fields

#### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Payment gateway integration
- Order completion process
- Database validation
- Performance testing under load

### 5. Test Strategy and Approach
- **Testing Type:** Functional Testing, Negative Testing
- **Testing Method:** Automated testing using Playwright and Python
- **Framework:** Pytest with Playwright integration
- **Approach:** Data-driven testing using iterative combinations of field states
- **Validation Method:** Comprehensive testing of all 2^n combinations where n = number of mandatory fields

### 6. Test Environment
- **Application Under Test:** https://www.saucedemo.com/
- **Browser:** Chromium (Playwright default)
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Testing Framework:** Pytest + Playwright
